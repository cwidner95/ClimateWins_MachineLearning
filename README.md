# ClimateWins_MachineLearning
Using Python to test multiple machine learning algorithims to predict weather patterns.

## Objective
Working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit, help predict the consequences of climate change with the use of machine learning

## Key Questions
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, What have been the minimums and maximums in temperature been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather condtions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, could it be possible to predict danger?)

## Data
The following datasets were used for analysis:
- Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv
- Dataset-Answers-Weather_Prediction_Pleasant_Weather.csv

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: For data analysis
- Numpy: For mathematical equations
- Seaborn: For data visualizations
- Matplotlib: For data visualizations
- SKlearn: For machine learning algorithims

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- **01 Project Management:** The project brief
- **02 Data:** Separated into two subfolders (Original and Prepared Data), these contain the original data and the cleaned and prepared data (Note: Scaled dataset not uploaded due to file size)
- **03 Scripts:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for analysis
- **04 Analysis:** Contains visualizations and reports that explain findings
